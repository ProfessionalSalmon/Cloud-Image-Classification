# Cloud Image Classification by CNN
## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end implementation of a Cloud Image Classification model using deep learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook (cloud.ipynb) walks through the entire process, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## Features

- **Dataset Handling:** Loads and processes cloud images for training and testing.

- **Data Augmentation:** Enhances dataset variability to improve model robustness.

- **Model Architecture:** Implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict cloud categories.

- **Training & Evaluation**
